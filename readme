*********************************

Notes:

Glance is built using Semantic UI, PHP and Javascript.

Instead of a stale profile and a couple blurry pictures, Glance encourages users to express
themselves through daily posts. Think Twitter/Facebook for dating.

This is a Stateful platform that uses php sessions to manage activity.
While a (mostly) Stateless design was possible at the time of writing, using
DynamoDB or a caching server to manage sessions was too costly for this project.

If you plan to scale this app out (instead of up) you will most likely want to modify the code to
be stateless but in my testing, my load balancer rarely switched servers once a user was
authenticated and using Glance. So, it's your call :-)

The "recovery" and "signup" folders have their own asset directories..
while this seems redundant, this allows you to change their location on the
server. BE SURE TO UPDATE THE FILE INCLUDES if you change the dir location)

The system can be run on just about any linux setup but it was designed for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Linux,
RDS server running MySQL
