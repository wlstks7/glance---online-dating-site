*********************************

This is the code for the image server(s). It was designed to receive POSTS from the Glance web servers and
handle the heavy lifting when resizing and storing the images to S3.

If you are using AWS you should keep these private (behind your firewall) and have the web servers connect on
your private network (instead of public addressed)

If you choose to make these servers public, you can pass a secure key during POST to authenticate
the web server (defined in config-inc.php)

The image server accepts posted images and returns JSON with the image location on S3

Ubuntu Linux recommended - (or your favorite dist)
PHP 5.6+
PHP Extensions:
